# About YSuite
YSuite is a series of pre-built plug-and-play modules for Starbase. The modules are made in such a way that they work with default device field names where necessary.
The goal of YSuite is to provide a way for players to easily use some more advanced systems on their ships, without having to dive into YOLOL coding.
